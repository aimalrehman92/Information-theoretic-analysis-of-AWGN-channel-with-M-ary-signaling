# Information theoretic analysis of AWGN channel with M-ary signaling

This repository contains:
1. Mathemtical derivation for the formulation of already known capacity of the AWGN channel (thanks to Claude Shannon).
2. MATLAB codes for the theoretic bounds on the achievable rate as a function of modulation depth and source transmit power.
